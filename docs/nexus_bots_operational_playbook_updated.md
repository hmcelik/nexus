# Nexus Bots – Operational Playbook & Risk Response Plan (Post-Audit Polished Edition)

---

## 1. Purpose & Alignment with Product Vision

This playbook ensures that Nexus Bots operates reliably, securely, and in alignment with our **modular, visual bot-building platform** vision. It bridges the gap between product development and live operations, supporting Creators, Power Users, and Developers with consistent uptime, robust security, and predictable scalability.

## 2. Monitoring & Alerts

- **Golden Signals:**
  - **Rate:** Flow executions per second per tenant.
  - **Errors:** Failed node executions, webhook retries.
  - **Duration:** Execution time per flow.
  - **Queue Depth:** Pending webhook jobs and message queues.
  - **Latency:** End-to-end message processing time.
- **Alert Thresholds:**
  - SEV1: Error rate exceeds 10% for any tenant.
  - SEV2: Error rate exceeds 5% platform-wide.
  - Queue depth exceeds 500 pending jobs for over 2 minutes.
  - Latency exceeds 2 seconds at the 95th percentile.
- **Tools:** Prometheus/Grafana, cloud provider metrics, AI-driven anomaly detection.
- **Escalation Path:** On-call DevOps → Lead Engineer → Product Owner.

## 3. Incident Response Procedures

### Severity Levels

- **SEV1:** Total platform outage or data breach.
- **SEV2:** Major platform function degraded (e.g., execution delays exceeding 5 seconds).
- **SEV3:** Issue affecting a single tenant.
- **SEV4:** Minor bug with no SLA breach.

### Response Steps

1. **Acknowledge:** Triage within 5 minutes (SEV1/SEV2).
2. **Contain:** Disable faulty nodes/plugins and route traffic to failover.
3. **Communicate:**
   - Internal: Slack war room.
   - External: Status page updates.
4. **Recover:** Apply fix or rollback.
5. **Post-Mortem:** Document cause, resolution, and prevention; store in the internal runbook repository.

## 4. Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** 15 minutes.
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** 30 minutes.
- **Backups:** Encrypted database snapshots every 15 minutes, stored in multi-region locations.
- **Restore Drills:** Conducted quarterly.
- **Failover:** Active/passive regional redundancy.

---

## 5. Security Event Handling

- **Detection:** Automated alerts for anomalous logins, API usage spikes, and AI-driven anomaly detection.
- **Containment:** Token revocation and IP blocking.
- **User Notification:** Within 72 hours of confirmed breach (GDPR compliance).
- **Coordination:** Legal and compliance teams informed within 30 minutes.

---

## 6. Capacity Planning & Scaling Guidelines

- **Baseline:** Managed ECS/App Engine autoscaling.
- **Triggers:**
  - CPU usage exceeds 70% for over 5 minutes.
  - Memory usage exceeds 75% for over 5 minutes.
  - Queue depth exceeds 500 for over 2 minutes.
  - DB connection pool usage exceeds 80%.
- **Expansion:** Kubernetes migration at Phase C scale.
- **Cost Optimization:** Reserved instances for predictable workloads.

---

## 7. Maintenance & Deployment Policies

- **Maintenance Windows:** Low-traffic periods (UTC 02:00–04:00).
- **Deployment Strategy:** Blue/green for major updates, canary releases for minor updates.
- **Rollback:** CI/CD pipeline supports immediate rollback.

---

## 8. Compliance & Accessibility Checks

- **GDPR/CCPA:** Monthly review of the data retention matrix.
- **Analytics Consent:** Verification of opt-in/opt-out analytics tracking for all tenants.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA audits twice annually, with remediation tasks tracked in the runbook.
- **Marketplace Governance:**
  - Quarterly publisher verification and plugin scan reviews.
  - **Malicious Plugin Response:** Immediate takedown, plugin disabled in affected bots, impacted users notified within 24 hours.

---

## 9. Roles & Responsibilities

- **On-Call DevOps:** First response to alerts and incidents.
- **Security Lead:** Breach investigation and mitigation.
- **Product Owner:** Stakeholder communication and roadmap alignment.
- **Support Team:** Customer-facing updates.

---

## 10. Continuous Improvement

- **Quarterly Post-Mortem Review:** Identify incident patterns.
- **Annual DR Test:** Full failover simulation.
- **Feedback Loop:** Incorporate lessons learned into Dev Specs, Vision, and Website Plan.
- **Runbook Maintenance:** All procedures documented and maintained in an internal repository.

---

**Summary:** This updated playbook integrates predictive alerting, expanded capacity metrics, analytics consent enforcement, accessibility remediation workflows, and explicit marketplace incident handling, ensuring operations remain secure, compliant, and closely aligned with Nexus Bots’ product vision.
