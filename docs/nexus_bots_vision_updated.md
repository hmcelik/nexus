# Nexus Bots: Visual Bot Development & Scalable Automation Platform (Post-Audit Polished Edition)

---

## 1. Product Vision

Nexus Bots is a modular, visual bot-building platform designed for **Creators**, **Power Users**, and **Developers**. It combines no-code simplicity with developer-level extensibility, enabling users to build, deploy, and scale advanced bots for Telegram, Discord, and other platforms.

To address the **“no-code vs. developer-centric”** gap, the platform introduces feature modes:

- **Creator Mode:** Templates and baseline nodes.
- **Power Mode:** Advanced nodes and integrations.
- **Developer Mode:** SDK access, Git workflows, and plugin authoring.

---

## 2. Core Product Goals

- Provide an **extensible, secure, and scalable** bot development environment.
- Simplify onboarding with a first-run sandbox bot.
- Ensure multi-platform parity by delivering a baseline cross-platform node set before platform-specific nodes.
- Embed strong **security, compliance, and observability** from the outset.

## 3. Architecture & Feature Modules

### Module 1: Core Platform & User Experience

#### Authentication & Identity

- OAuth 2.0 (Google, Discord, Telegram)
- Multi-bot and multi-platform support per account
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with clearly defined resources, actions, and conditions

#### Dashboard Interface

- Centralized bot list with status, traffic, and error metrics
- Secure bot actions: edit, duplicate, delete, and debug

#### Bot Provisioning

- Tokens stored in a KMS-encrypted vault
- Scoped, short-lived tokens for plugins and webhooks
- UI to manage token rotation and view last-rotated timestamps

#### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- Per-tenant isolation boundaries
- Redis Cluster with TTL discipline and bounded session payloads
- Regional hosting options for compliance requirements

---

### Module 2: Visual Bot Builder (Blueprint Editor)

#### Node Library

- **Baseline Cross-Platform Nodes:** Trigger, Send Message, Variables, HTTP Request, If/Else, Delay/Timer, JSON Parse
- **Telegram Extensions:** Show Keyboard, Wait for Reply, Get User Info
- **Discord Extensions:** Slash Command, Assign Role, Send Embed (voice deferred)
- **AI Nodes:** Prompt library with versioning, moderation filters, cost tracking, and per-tenant quotas

#### Developer Tools

- Live debugging with visual trace
- Simulation mode with event mocking and clock control
- Versioned flow schema with canonical formatting
- Visual merge conflict resolver for Git workflows

---

### Module 3: Backend Engine & Deployment

#### Webhook Ingress Layer

- Queue-based ingestion (SQS/Pub/Sub) with idempotency store
- Retry logic with exponential backoff and DLQ
- Circuit breakers for backpressure control

#### Flow Execution Engine

- Deterministic step runner with exactly-once semantics
- Transactional variable updates with compensation hooks
- Per-node timeouts and cancellation tokens

#### Auto-Deployment Infrastructure

- Initial deployment via ECS/App Engine (Kubernetes deferred until scale)
- Audit logs for deployments and executions
- Observability with RED/USE metrics and PII-redacted structured logs

---

## 4. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS, React Flow
- **Backend:** NestJS, Node.js, TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (JSONB for flows)
- **Cache:** Redis Cluster
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, ECS/App Engine, managed KMS
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions with secret scanning gates
- **AI:** Gemini API with OpenAI fallback and safety filters

---

## 5. Development Roadmap

### Phase A (Weeks 1–8)

- Telegram MVP with baseline nodes
- Logging and basic test runner
- RBAC basics
- First-run sandbox bot for onboarding
- Single-region managed hosting

### Phase B (Weeks 9–16)

- Multi-tenant isolation and observability hardening
- Marketplace Alpha with publisher verification and security review
- AI quota controls and cost tracking

### Phase C (Weeks 17–24)

- Discord support (excluding voice features)
- Billing system implementation
- Advanced AI features for paid tiers

---

## 6. Marketplace Governance

- Signed plugin artifacts with publisher verification
- Static analysis, SBOM, and dependency scans prior to publishing
- Clear refund, dispute, and DMCA policies
- Transparent revenue share terms

---

## 7. Security, Compliance & Acceptance Criteria

- All tokens encrypted with managed KMS; rotation UI available
- GDPR/CCPA compliance, with data retention matrix
- Versioned flow schema with migration framework
- Test DSL with fixtures integrated into CI pipeline
- Prompt registry with safety filters and opt-in AI data sharing

---

**Summary:** This polished vision aligns with the audit’s recommendations, combining realistic scope, phased delivery, and a robust foundation for security, compliance, and long-term scalability.
